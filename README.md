# GeoTrellis template REST service project

This project is a template for creating a geoprocessing web service with
GeoTrellis.  It's an initial project that is a blank slate for your own 
development by providing an initial development environment that is set up
with the necessary dependencies in place.  The project loads GeoTrellis as a
library, and has a very simple "hello world" web service in place for you 
to edit.

# Install

## Install conscript
[install][csrm] the `cs` program, following the instructions on the Conscript page. 

## Install g8

Install the `g8` program, which makes it easy to install application templates.

Just run:

     cs n8han/giter8

## Get the template

Run:

    g8 softprops/conscript-example

## Start coding

See the [getting started guide](http://azavea.github.com/geotrellis/getting_started/GeoTrellis.html)
for more information on available operations, importing your data, and creating
your web service.

If you want to start looking at some code, take a look at at Demo REST service 
included with the core
GeoTrellis repository (https://github.com/azavea/geotrellis) as an example of how
to build your own geoprocessing service.

## Step 1: Run SBT

This project uses SBT, the Scala Build Tool, for compilation and execution.

At the command line, go to the directory where you've installed this template
and run `./sbt`.  For example:

Create the template:
```bash
g8 geotrellis/geotrellis.g8
```

Change to the directory created, which is based on the name you provided to g8:

```bash
cd gt-template 
```

and then run sbt, after making the sbt script runnable:

```bash
chmod 755 ./sbt
./sbt
```

The first time you run SBT, there will be a significant delay as all of the
necessary libraries are downloaded.

If you get any sort of error that a library can't be downloaded, please let us 
know so we can fix the problem. SBT downloads the libraries from where they
are hosted on the internet, so problems can arise when repositories change.  

When sbt is done loading and compiling, you'll see an sbt prompt:

``` 
 >
```

If you type `run`, you'll see some messages from Jetty, the embedded webserver
that responds to GeoTrellis requests.

```
 > run
[info] Starting server on port 8888.
[error] 2012-02-06 14:17:08.255:INFO:oejs.Server:jetty-8.1.0.RC4
[error] 2012-02-06 14:17:08.329:INFO:oejs.AbstractConnector:Started SelectChannelConnector@0.0.0.0:8888 STARTING
```

This means that you are now running a webserver on port 8888 that responds to
requests.  Go to [http://localhost:8888/template](http://localhost:8888/template)
to see the template web service, which displays "Hello GeoTrellis!" or whatever
message you provided for g8.

## Step 2: Configuration and data import

See the [Setting Up GeoTrellis page](http://geotrellis.github.com/gettingstarted/settingup.html)
for information about configuring your GeoTrellis instance and importing your data.

## Step 3: Create your service

The blank REST service is in the file `src/main/scala/geotrellis/rest/TemplateResource.scala`.
Edit that file to change the existing service, or create a similar class in the
`geotrellis.rest` package to create a new service.
